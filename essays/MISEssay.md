	While I did not initially start at Shidler with the intention of becoming an MIS major, I am definitely glad I made the switch to become one! I took ICS111 last year, and I absolutely loved it! I enjoyed being faced with difficult challenges and finding solutions to them. Despite being one of the most challenging classes I had taken, it made me realize that I wanted to do something more technology oriented within Shidler. I have always had a strong interest in technology because I love the innovative aspect of it and the power that it has to change and improve people's lives. It is so exciting to see how fast technology is evolving and growing in so many different ways. What I enjoy about MIS is how it intersects both business and technology and uses technology to improve and grow organizations. Career wise, I am not sure specifically what I want to do with my MIS degree, but I do hope to utilize technology to make a positive impact on the world.
