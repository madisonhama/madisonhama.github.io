Browser History 1 and 2 were fairly easy to me because they covered concepts that I had done before or that we had done in class. For Browser History 1, I practiced a few times, then watched the video, and then recorded myself doing it and I was able to complete it in under 15 minutes. My experience with Browser History 2 was very similar, as I just practiced multiple times so that I could remember the correct CSS formatting for that WOD and I was able to complete this in under 10 minutes. Browser History 3 was a little bit more difficult for me because I had never formatted a html page with side-by-side columns or a navigation bar before. I tried to do Browser History 3 once on my own, but could not get it exactly correct, as I struggled with creating the navigation bar, so after that I watched the video of Professor Johnson completing it. After watching the video and practicing Browser History 3 multiple times, I was able to complete it in under 10 minutes. Overall, the WODs were time consuming, but not as time consuming as I had initially expected. It did not take a very long time to figure out how to code each page, but it did take a long time to remember how to do each step while I was recording my video. There would be times when I was recording my video and I would completely forget how to do the next step so I would have to end and restart the video. I probably re-recorded some of the WODs over 5 times! It felt great when I finally completed a WOD recording without messing up or forgetting what to do next and I realized that with lots of practice it became easier to remember what to do for each step over time. My advice would be to keep practicing! It can be frustrating to not be able to figure out how to do a WOD or to keep messing it up, but I found that practicing multiple times helped me tremendously.
